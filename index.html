        <h2>&#10148; A little about me...</h2>
        <p>I'm passionate about tinkering and problem-solving, whether it be on back-end systems or front-end user experiences. I am restless
        when it comes to programming, constantly striving to solve problems while also giving a great deal of attention to the cleanliness and
        convention of my code. It's my goal to create things that are not just beneficial to my immediate needs, but useful, maintainable, and
        expandable by future coders in the community. I was an EMT for over two years in the city of Chicago, and I highly value the problem-
        solving and team-working skills I gained during that time.</p>
